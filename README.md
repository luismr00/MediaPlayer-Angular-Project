## Key Functionalities

To start interacting with the media player, first press one of the repeat buttons at the very bottom once. After that, you can now interact with the rest of the media player buttons to play/pause, skip, and return to the previous song.

To interact with the darkmode UI, press the button that displays at the very top of the webpage. Please keep in mind this feature is still incomplete, but it portrays the basics on how UI styling can be changed.
